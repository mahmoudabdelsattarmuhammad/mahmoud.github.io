"**Adopt, Adapt .. Innovate**" is one of main strategies to apply for new products, processes , it means beginning by **adopting** one of the already existing solutions that fulfills most your needs and then **adapting** it to most fit your requirements and by the time start improve it finally **innovate** a new solution to achieve maximum efficiency

**Why this strategy is efficient:**

- A good point to start from a robust solution

- It helps you to implement the requirements rapidly and gain a fast win with cost efficiency most of time
